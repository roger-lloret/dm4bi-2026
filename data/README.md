# Data Directory

This directory contains sample datasets for learning and practicing data pipeline development.

## Available Datasets

### Sample Sales Data
Coming soon - sample datasets will be generated by running the examples.

## Adding Your Own Data

You can add your own datasets here for practice:

1. Keep files reasonably small (< 10 MB)
2. Use common formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet
3. Include a description of the data
4. Document any data quality issues

## Data Format Guidelines

### CSV Files
- Include headers
- Use UTF-8 encoding
- Handle special characters properly
- Document delimiter if not comma

### JSON Files
- Use consistent structure
- Pretty-print for readability
- Include schema documentation

## Sample Data Creation

Many examples create their own sample data automatically. For example:

```python
# Create sample sales data
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'order_id': range(1, 101),
    'customer_id': [f'C{i:04d}' for i in range(1, 101)],
    'amount': [100 + i * 10 for i in range(100)],
})

df.to_csv('data/sample_sales.csv', index=False)
```

## Data Privacy

**Important:** Never commit sensitive or personal data to this repository!

- Use synthetic/dummy data only
- Remove any PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- Anonymize real data before adding

## Data Sources

Good sources for practice datasets:
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)

## Generated Data

The data directory is included in `.gitignore` patterns to avoid committing large files. Generated outputs from running examples will appear here but won't be committed to the repository.
